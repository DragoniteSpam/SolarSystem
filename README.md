# Solar System

Several years ago I made a "3D solar system" as a bit of a personal tech demo in Game Maker: Studio. I've finally gotten off my lazy butt and imported it through GMS2, just in case I feel like doing more stuff with it in the future.

It's been on [Itch](https://dragonite.itch.io/game-maker-3d-solar-system) for a while. I may or may not update it.
